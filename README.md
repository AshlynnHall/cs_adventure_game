# Overview

When I was in high school, I actually really wanted to be a writer because I loved to read. This program was very fun to develop because I got to write many different versions of the same story!
The user gets to read what is happening and then decide between two options of what they're going to do next. Their choices lead the story and the user decides what happens next. It's fun and
engaging. I wanted to accomplish learning more about C# and it's functionality while developing a fun software for both myself and the user.

# Development Environment

I used C#, including the system libary. I wrote my program in Visual Studio Code and downloaded .NET SDK to my laptop to properly run the software.
